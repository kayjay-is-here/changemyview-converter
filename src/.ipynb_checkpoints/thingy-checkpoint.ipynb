According to government stats less than a quarter of all heroin users ever become dependent on it. It has a high rate of dependency compared to other drugs, but the vast majority of users never become dependent - even if you assume that that figure is a conservative estimate.\\n\\n[Source](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin)\",\n",
       " '> Drugs\\n\\nThis part is interesting because of the description of the complex nature of the situation. In the case of crimes resulting from drugs, I mentioned below that I believe the crime itself should be the primary offence, and the drug use which facilitated it would be a secondary offence that get tagged onto crimes. This would punish those who go crazy from drugs, without inherently punishing anyone for possession or use who has otherwise done nothing wrong. As to the rest, I understand the nature of the complex situation, but I\\'m not convinced that most people really think of it logically to that extent, nor that it is a problem helped by pushing it into the dark and more obscure recesses of society. Imagine momentarily a society where these kinds of drugs were legal and regulated the same way as a prescription or over the counter medication. Safe pre-made doses, regulated by bodies who can test that companies are making them to be as clean as possible, not something people have to do secretively in a dark alley trying to make sure they don\\'t get caught. I think part of the open use would be a more constructive conversation about the potential for abuse, and a reduction in drug related crimes and deaths. When we had high school drug intervention speeches, the officers came in with posters of dead kids and stories... almost all of them ended with \"his friend saw him passed out, got scared about someone finding out, and ran away leaving him to die without medical attention\". If there wasn\\'t the fear of punishment for using the drugs, I think a lot of these lives senselessly lost could have been saved. Beyond that... I can see what you\\'re saying about the issues with family and state, and the complex situations that could arise... but I think the current stigma of \"just trying to get high is wrong\" marginalizes and generalized a much more complex issue without leaving open a discussion for the complexity that surrounds it. \\n\\n> Incest\\n\\nThe big point you made was about children with parents, and about family matters. As for births, recessive genes isn\\'t a great argument since we don\\'t live in a eugenic society. People have disabled kids all the time, no one is legally stopping them. As for children with parents, I made the point below that it should be a discussion of people of consenting age... not that some mother was manipulating their 6 year old to pleasure them. Paedophilia is a separate debate, and something of a grey area beyond about age 14 or 15, but of course the power struggle is a concern, and I recognize that point. My argument was for 2 people above the legal age, however. As for a family dispute as a result... I think this is an issue even in normal relationships. Mother\\'s getting attached to girlfriends and trying to get them married, the fallout afterwards... same goes for friendship circles when 2 friends date. This is an issue of openness, discussion, and the maturity of the social group. If 2 people date and then break up and it causes some kind of dilemma, that\\'s an issue with the people not inherently the act itself. ',\n",
       " \"I can tell you 100% that all drugs should be legalized immediately, everything. The science on this is rock solid and beyond question. Particularly in the case of hard drugs abuse, these people always, always have some sort of history of extreme abuse or neglect in their lives. Their brains become wired specifically toward their drug of choice, opiates, amphetamines or both. A huge part of what keeps them down is the feeling of being social outcasts - feeling unable to integrate back into society, it's easier to turn back to addiction. In situations where they are treated with dignity, given access to health services. Even giving them access to free, clean drugs ends the cycle faster and more cheaply because they aren't exposing themselves to nearly as many risks like sexual abusing themselves, criminal behavior and the risk of OD. Experiments have been done and these things have been a resounding success.\\n\\nWhat's really happening is that the state is actually preying on these people. The vast state apparatus is proof of this, police, legal system, prisons. The corruption surrounding these entities is enormously powerful. \",\n",
       " 'Actually, let\\'s just take heroin for an example of a \"dangerous\" addictive drug. Is it really the drug that is causing the problem, or is it the person\\'s behaviour? It\\'s clearly the latter, since the drug is just a powder extracted from a plant, it\\'s not inherently problematic. It\\'s *connected* to problems, but that\\'s not to say it directly causes them. Is addiction the culprit? Not necessarily, as being addicted to something doesn\\'t harm anyone but the addict, and only when the addict chooses to perform antisocial actions to feed their addiction. Addiction is not even a socially devastating event in any case; plenty of cigarette smokers attest to the prevalence of benign addiction in our society. If heroin were not illegal it would cost pennies to feed a habit, meaning an addict would not have to rob or steal. If the argument is then that the intoxication leads to antisocial activities keep in mind that, again, we have plenty of intoxicating activities in our society (alcohol is the big one) and the moral fabric has not degraded to a point where we have been ruined by it. We are adults and we can choose appropriate times and places for intoxication. We forbid intoxication when it can be societally dangerous (driving, operating machines) and morally abhor it when we feel it is inappropriate (around children, etc).\\n\\nThere is no rational reason for us to condone some drugs and forbid others, only moral habit, ingrained by culture. Some people in the world have a greater propensity for self-destruction than others, and these people often turn to drugs to escape life and hurt themselves. This is up to them, as they are adults and they can do as they choose. It is a moral evasion for society to blame drugs for the problem and not the user, as it allows us to blame an externality for our problems rather than human nature, which is tantamount to avoiding taking responsibility for our own actions.',\n",

If a patient was given so many opiates they developed an addiction then that is a medical failing. If they've taken somebody else's medication and developed an addiction then, again, the real antisocial problems occur when they cannot get or afford their drugs anymore. Oxycontin sells for upwards of $30 a pill on the street, it's a crippling habit to afford.

Indeed, its prohibition was a complete disaster. So there is clearly a disconnect here if we are looking at prohibiting some drugs based purely on objective data.\\n\\nThe thing is, *plenty of things we do in life are dangerous.* And we don't prohibit them because we're grown adults and we can do what we want. Belief in personal freedom is a huge component of Western morality, yet we maintain drug prohibition when there is objective evidence that not only does it not work but also that it exacerbates the problems we have with illegal drugs rather than mitigating them.\\n\\nI agree with the OP, the only reason people object (mostly) to hard drug use is cultural conditioning.

It's just not cheap.

We may condemn this behaviour as a \"waste of their life\", but it\\'s arguably similar to sitting and watching TV or playing video games for hours on end, other activities that some people (i.e.: my parents\\' generation) consider a \"waste of their life.\" The true antisocial behaviours come from the addict trying to get more drug without the means, leading to the neglect of the normal parts of their life (work, housecleaning, proper food, etc) and theft, begging, etc. It could be argued that, say, methamphetamine would be a better candidate for prohibition since the behaviour of the individual *while on the drug* is more dangerous.

The Netherlands provides [heroin for free to addicts](https://news.vice.com/article/only-in-the-netherlands-do-addicts-complain-about-free-government-heroin) and it has had a massive public health benefit.

       " 'You\\'re right about the alcohol, which is why we ban *drunk driving*, not drinking itself. Similarly we ban driving under *any* intoxicant or *any* intoxicated state. Being sleepy isn\\'t illegal, but driving sleepy *is*. Getting drunk isn\\'t, but beating your wife while drunk *is.* That\\'s the distinction. I would argue people should not be driving or operating heavy machinery if they are impaired in any way at all, and I would suggest that being under the effects of *withdrawal* does not constitute proper sobriety.\\n\\nDrugs may predispose towards certain behaviours (and they do), like sitting around while high on pot, fighting while drunk, or being a loud asshole while on cocaine, but, again, this is not reason enough to ban the drug. We expect people to behave appropriately in society and not break the \"big\" laws (i.e.: cause harm to others), and if they are unable to do so they should be encouraged to stop by their friends, family, or whatever. It is not the role of the state to prevent activities which \"predispose\" towards certain behaviours as there is no certainty that a crime will be committed.

But by popular belief, _heroin_ is the worst of the lot, nothing else even comes close.\\n\\nMaybe you think overstating the risk is ok because it deters people from using it, how could that be a bad thing? I think that can be very bad. I think there is value in people understanding the true breadth and magnitude of the problem, both so that they can make informed decisions for themselves and for others. I think it's bad that people are so afraid of heroin that they won't even consider policies that could be construed as 'soft'. Decriminalized use, prescription heroin for addicts, syringe exchanges in many states, those options (though they have been shown to be effective at reducing the harms of abuse) are completely off the table because people are so afraid of it. I don't think that is helpful to users or to society.\",\n",
       " \"I don't know that most people did understand; I don't mean to attack or infer about you personally but in my experience both on Reddit and in real life (even with people who should know better, such as physicians), most people have a very exaggerated perception of heroin - thinking that it's addicting after the first time, or that 90% of people who use it die from it, or that heroin users are criminal junkies, or what have you. Your description implicitly reinforced those stereotypes, and I think that contributes to the harmful stigmas that are the subject of this thread. \\n\\nBoth times in the past that I have brought up the 25% figure on Reddit in the past, people have been very, very surprised and even disbelieving of it because it is so much lower than what they would have assumed. If we're going to talk about a subject that most people have misperceptions about, I think full objective disclosure and not playing into stereotypes is important.\",\n",

       " \"Haha, okay, you got me, that's a good point. :) But still, we don't ban alcohol because of drunk driving! Similarly, I see no reason to ban other drugs because they also get you intoxicated, and especially considering the intoxication from some of them is benign.\",\n",
       " \"You are not reading that study correctly.  Or rather you are also ignoring the percentage of people who tried it in the first place.  Notice that only 2% of the people interviewed for that study tried Heroin... and 23% became addicted.\\n\\nThe low percentage of people interviewed who have actually tried heroin, makes the percentage more powerful.  From such a small sample group and a quarter of them became addicted?  That is huge.  Also it is ignoring that alcohol and tobacco are sold cheaply and legally and alcohol is basically a cultural norm at this point.  The majority of people interviewed in that study had tried alcohol or cigarettes. If heroin was as socially accepted as cigarettes and alcohol, the percentage would go up.\\n\\nAlso one thing we haven't covered yet is the withdrawal process.  Heroin and cigarettes may be comparable in terms of addictiveness, but Heroin is harder to kick. Opioid withdrawal causes chills, cramps, sweating, diarrhea, nausea, anxiety, etc.  Nicotine withdrawal causes anxiety, difficulty in concentration and constipation.  Withdrawing from Heroin is a complete nightmare. \\n\\nIt is worth noting that heroin on its own (in proper non lethal doses) carries very little health risks.  It causes constipation and possibly some kidney damage, even after long term use. Heroin is feared as the big scary monster of the drug world, because it so hard to get off once you are addicted. \\n\\nI don't believe in overstating any risks.  The risk of heroin speaks for itself.  For the record, I think most drugs should be legal and ALL drugs decriminalized... But thats why its so important not to downplay the destructive nature of Heroin.  It shouldn't be illegal anymore than rat poison is illegal, but it should handled with about as much care.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"Ok, I accept your viewpoint, but you are actually reading the source wrong. The 2% number on the left is a portion of the total population and the number on the right is a percentage _of that 2%_. If the number of users went up from say 2% to 3% of the population, the _absolute number_ of heroin-dependent users would go up - 23% of a bigger number is obviously more than 23% of a smaller number - but the rate would stay the same at 23%. Only 2% trying it doesn't make the 23% 'more powerful.' If anything, it does the opposite...\\n\\n> If heroin was as socially accepted as cigarettes and alcohol, the percentage would go up.\\n\\nIf the number of heroin users changed so drastically that it included a significant portion of the population, the rate of dependency might change somewhat - but we would expect it to go down, not up. The reason is this: heroin is currently socially unacceptable and a very uncommon drug. The 2% who are doing it now _despite those social stigmas_ are probably more risk-taking, impulsive, antisocial, less health-conscious, etc than the average person. People with these traits are more likely to become dependent, so they bring the dependency rate up. That rate of dependency is basically selecting for people who are more likely to become drug-dependent than the average person.\\n\\nConversely, almost everyone has used alcohol. So the population of alcohol users not only includes the same types of anti-social risk-takers that use heroin, but also people with average and above average risk-aversion and impulse control. These people are less likely to become dependent so they bring the overall dependency rate of alcohol down -they compensate for the high-risk people.\",\n",
